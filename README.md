Structure
Header & Navigation
A <header> with a meaningful <h1> (e.g., "Web Accessibility Homepage").
A <nav> with links to:🔹 #Home – Homepage🔹 #about – Short introduction to the team
A "Skip to Content" link to let keyboard users jump straight to the quiz.

Todo:

- find content for our site (ex. unsplash or google)
- start working on the html when agnes can join us, mob programming
- divide work into branches
- connect all the buttons and nav links when we have made the other pages
- change the "learn more" buttons to more accessable, ex. "learn more about us"

- add a "skip to content" link for screen readers
- "Use :focus-visible for clear focus indicators."

*****stuff to fix: 
- trap on hamburger menu, and fix so it doesn't read the stuff on the main page before the ham menu is closed
